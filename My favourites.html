    <h2 class="orange">Royal Carribbean Cruise Ship</h2>

    <p>
      The Cruise Ship is a wonderful vacation. They have different sizes of
      ships and it's like a floating hotel that takes you from city to city or
      from island to island. I like to go on cruises to the different islands
      and food.

    <p>
      My favourite type of dog breed would be a golden retriever since they are
      loyal and super fluffy and cute.

    <p>
      My country Guyana in South America. It's a very tropical place and both my
      Mom and Dad were born in Georgetown, Guyana. I was born here in Canada but
      I have Guyanese blood in me.

    <p>
      I could eat pancakes any time of the day for breakfast, lunch and dinner!
      It's so yummy and tasty. Pancakes are my go-to food. I could eat pancakes
      whatever moood I'm in.
